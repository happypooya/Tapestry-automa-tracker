# Tapestry Automa Tracker

Welcome to my Tapestry Automa Tracker! This is my personal version of the Automa, offering a different experience than the official Automa Factory. **This app is designed to be used in conjunction with my custom Automa rules, which complement the functionality provided here.** Track the game state easily for solo or cooperative play.

## Features

* **Track Positions:** Keep track of player and Automa positions on all five advancement tracks.
* **Automa Turns:** Simulate Automa's turn based on its character (Normal or Strategic), including resource cost deduction and automatic landmark claiming on tracks.
* **Resource & Building Tracking:** Monitor Automa's resources and building counts.
* **Landmark Status:** See the status of all landmarks.
* **Game History:** View a history of turns and actions.
* **Persistence:** Game state is saved in your browser's local storage.
* **Manual Adjustments:** Options to manually correct resources, buildings, and positions.

## How to Use

1.  Save the provided HTML code as an `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`).
2.  Open the file in your web browser.
3.  Set up the Automa's color and character.
4.  Use the buttons to advance Automa's turn or record player actions.
5.  **Refer to the companion custom Automa rules for details on actions not automated by the app (e.g., combat, specific space benefits, income phase steps).**
